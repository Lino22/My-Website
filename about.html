            <p>Hello, my name is Rosolino Mangano but people call me Lino for short. I grew up in an Italian-American household in Long Island, but in 2019 I moved to Queens. As of right now, I am 22 years old and I just received my Bachelors of Busniess Administration degree from Baruch College. My major was computer information systems in the cybersecurity track.</p>
            
            <p>I gained a passion for technology when I first started playing computer games and watching YouTube videos on my Dad's personal computer before I knew how to read and write. When I got a little older, I was blown away when someone told me that you could make a living with computers. So I knew that I wanted to do something with computers since childhood, but I decided to study cybersecurity when one of my high school classes had a guest speaker talking about their experiences with "ethical hacking" and how they baiscally got paid a lot money to hack all of these famous companies. I thought it was a hoax at first, but after that school day I went and did my research and found myself in a whole world that I never knew about. So in my junior year when my guidance counselor told me what I wanted to go to college for, I told her that I wanted to study cybersecurity. Afterwards, I told my parents what I wanted to do as well and they seemed proud.</p>
            
            <p>Besides coding and playing video games, I also really like listen to music, going to the gym, watching sports, and travelling. When it comes to travelling within the United States, going to Florida is my favorite. Not only for the amazing weather all-year round, but also for the theme parks. I am also an adrenaline junkie as well so this works perfectly in my favor. When we can't fly to Florida, going to Six Flags is also an incredible experience.</p>
            
            <p>Travelling is fun no matter what, but my favorite kind of travel is international travel. I have been to over 7 different countries as well as been on 2 different cruises. My favorite country that I have been has got to be Jamaica. This is because even though I have been there multiple times the weather, beaches, and food were perfect. The country I want to go to the most is Japan. I like to travel internationally mainly because of all the new food I get to try. Despite being almost 100% Italian, my favorite cuisines are Mexican, Thai, and Japanese.</p>
            
            <p>When it comes to sports, I like to watch baseball and football. My favorite teams are the New York Yankees and the Buffalo Bills. If I had to choose between the two, I would have to choose football as my favorite because it is so much more intersting to watch than baseball in my opinion.</p>
